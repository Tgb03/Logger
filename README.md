# Logger

This app aims to streamline using logs to get all the data from them automatically.

# Features

## AutoSplitter: 
- [ ] Real time splitter
- [x] Automatically read and show end times of runs
- [x] Calculate total time of runs and theoretical best
- [ ] Remove broken splits or splits that are supposed to be ignored
- [ ] Saving runs

## WardenMapper:
- [ ] Automatically find keys.
- [ ] Automatically find objective items.


# How to use:

Open the app and press the "Input Speedrun Logs..." button on the top left, now select all the logs you wish to input.
Now all the runs have been opened, you can play around and see what each button does, if you wish to restart simply press the button again and reinput the same logs.
Once you are done checking out the runs and selecting whether the run attempted secondary or overload, you can save each one individiually or all of them.
You can then press the check saved runs to see more data about each level and run such as best splits, total time spent running that level or other information.

# Beware:

There are issues with the app which can cause the times to be innacurate, always double check with a VOD for runs you are submitting and take the Theoretical Best Time with a grain of salt. It may be innacurate.
